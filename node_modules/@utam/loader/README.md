# UTAM Loader

`@utam/loader` exposes a function constructor that can be used to create stateful loader objects. Loader objects
allow you to load page objects through the `load` API and expose all frame-related APIs.

Loader objects can be instantiated directly through this package or via a test runner integration.
For instance, the [wdio-utam-service][npm-wdio-utam-service-pkg] package creates a new loader object and assigns it to
the global `utam` variable.

## Usage
